What conceited ass has been impertinent enough to dare to propose to you before I had proposed to you?</p><p>mabel chiltern.  Tommy Trafford, of course.  It is one of Tommy’s days for proposing.  He always proposes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, during the Season.</p><p>lord goring.  You didn’t accept him, I hope?</p><p>mabel chiltern.  I make it a rule never to accept Tommy.  That is why he goes on proposing.  Of course, as you didn’t turn up this morning, I very nearly said yes.  It would have been an excellent lesson both for him and for you if I had.  It would have taught you both better manners.</p></div> </div>
