Besides, I have arrived at the romantic stage.  When I saw you last night at the Chilterns’, I knew you were the only person I had ever cared for, if I ever have cared for anybody, Arthur.  And so, on the morning of the day you marry me, I will give you Robert Chiltern’s letter.  That is my offer.  I will give it to you now, if you promise to marry me.</p></div> </div>
