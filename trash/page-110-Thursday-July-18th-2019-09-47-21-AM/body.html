You married a man with a future, didn’t you?  But then Robert was a genius, and you have a noble, self-sacrificing character.  You can stand geniuses.  I have no character at all, and Robert is the only genius I could ever bear.  As a rule, I think they are quite impossible.  Geniuses talk so much, don’t they?  Such a bad habit!  And they are always thinking about themselves, when I want them to be thinking about me.  I must go round now and rehearse at Lady Basildon’s.  You remember, we are having tableaux, don’t you?  The Triumph of something, I don’t know what!  I hope it will be triumph of me.  Only triumph I am really interested in at present.
