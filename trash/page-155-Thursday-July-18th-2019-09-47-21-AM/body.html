On the contrary, she occupies a rather high position in society.  It is a sort of open secret that Baron Arnheim left her the greater portion of his immense fortune.  Beyond that I can learn nothing.</p><p>lord goring.  She doesn’t turn out to be a spy, then?</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  Oh! spies are of no use nowadays.  Their profession is over.  The newspapers do their work instead.</p><p>lord goring.  And thunderingly well they do it.</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  Arthur, I am parched with thirst.  May I ring for something?  Some hock and seltzer?</p></div> </div>
