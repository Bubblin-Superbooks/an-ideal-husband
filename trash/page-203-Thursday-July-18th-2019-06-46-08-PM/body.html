When Montford passed me your letter across the table—he had opened it by mistake, I suppose, without looking at the handwriting on the envelope—and I read it—oh! I did not care what disgrace or punishment was in store for me, I only thought you loved me still.</p><p>lady chiltern.  There is no disgrace in store for you, nor any public shame.  Mrs. Cheveley has handed over to Lord Goring the document that was in her possession, and he has destroyed it.</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  Are you sure of this, Gertrude?</p><p>lady chiltern.  Yes; Lord Goring has just told me.</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  Then I am safe!  Oh! what a wonderful thing to be safe!  For two days I have been in terror.  I am safe now.  How did Arthur destroy my letter?  Tell me.</p></div> </div>
