An acquaintance that begins with a compliment is sure to develop into a real friendship.  It starts in the right manner.  And I find that I know Lady Chiltern already.</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  Really?</p><p>mrs. cheveley.  Yes.  She has just reminded me that we were at school together.  I remember it perfectly now.  She always got the good conduct prize.  I have a distinct recollection of Lady Chiltern always getting the good conduct prize!</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  [<em>Smiling</em>.]  And what prizes did you get, Mrs. Cheveley?</p><p>mrs. cheveley.  My prizes came a little later on in life.  I donâ€™t think any of them were for good conduct.  I forget!</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  I am sure they were for something charming!</p></div> </div>
