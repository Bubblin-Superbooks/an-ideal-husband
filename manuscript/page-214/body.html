Your relations with Mrs. Cheveley have, as I said to you last night, nothing whatsoever to do with me.  I know you were engaged to be married to her once.  The fascination she exercised over you then seems to have returned.  You spoke to me last night of her as of a woman pure and stainless, a woman whom you respected and honoured.  That may be so.  But I cannot give my sister’s life into your hands.  It would be wrong of me.  It would be unjust, infamously unjust to her.</p><p>lord goring.  I have nothing more to say.</p><p>lady chiltern.
