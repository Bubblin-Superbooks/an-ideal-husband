Well, at any rate, may I know if it is politics or pleasure?</p><p>mrs. cheveley.  Politics are my only pleasure.  You see nowadays it is not fashionable to flirt till one is forty, or to be romantic till one is forty-five, so we poor women who are under thirty, or say we are, have nothing open to us but politics or philanthropy.

I think they are more . . . becoming!</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  A political life is a noble career!</p><p>mrs. cheveley.  Sometimes.  And sometimes it is a clever game, Sir Robert.  And sometimes it is a great nuisance.</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  Which do you find it?</p><p>mrs. cheveley.  I?  A combination of all three.  [<em>Drops her fan</em>.]</p></div> </div>
