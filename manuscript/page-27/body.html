I am sure they were for something charming!</p><p>mrs. cheveley.  I don’t know that women are always rewarded for being charming.  I think they are usually punished for it!

To attempt to classify you, Mrs. Cheveley, would be an impertinence.  But may I ask, at heart, are you an optimist or a pessimist?  Those seem to be the only two fashionable religions left to us nowadays.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">mrs. cheveley.  Oh, I’m neither.
