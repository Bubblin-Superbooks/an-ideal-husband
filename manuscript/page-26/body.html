<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>mrs. cheveley.  I don’t know that women are always rewarded for being charming.  I think they are usually punished for it!  Certainly, more women grow old nowadays through the faithfulness of their admirers than through anything else!  At least that is the only way I can account for the terribly haggard look of most of your pretty women in London!</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  What an appalling philosophy that sounds!  To attempt to classify you, Mrs. Cheveley, would be an impertinence.  But may I ask, at heart, are you an optimist or a pessimist?  Those seem to be the only two fashionable religions left to us nowadays.</p><p>mrs. cheveley.  Oh, I’m neither.  Optimism begins in a broad grin, and Pessimism ends with blue spectacles.  Besides, they are both of them merely poses.</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  You prefer to be natural?</p><p>mrs. cheveley.  Sometimes.  But it is such a very difficult pose to keep up.</p></div> </div>
