Yes; Lord Goring has just told me.</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  Then I am safe!  Oh! what a wonderful thing to be safe!  For two days I have been in terror.  I am safe now.  How did Arthur destroy my letter?  Tell me.</p><p>lady chiltern.  He burned it.</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  I wish I had seen that one sin of my youth burning to ashes.  How many men there are in modern life who would like to see their past burning to white ashes before them!  Is Arthur still here?</p><p>lady chiltern.  Yes; he is in the conservatory.</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  I am so glad now I made that speech last night in the House, so glad.  I made it thinking that public disgrace might be the result.  But it has not been so.</p><p>lady chiltern.  Public honour has been the result.</p></div> </div>
