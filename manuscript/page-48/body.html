I want you to withdraw the report that you had intended to lay before the House, on the ground that you have reasons to believe that the Commissioners have been prejudiced or misinformed, or something.  Then I want you to say a few words to the effect that the Government is going to reconsider the question, and that you have reason to believe that the Canal, if completed, will be of great international value.  You know the sort of things ministers say in cases of this kind.  A few ordinary platitudes will do.  In modern life nothing produces such an effect as a good platitude.  It makes the whole world kin.  Will you do that for me?</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  Mrs. Cheveley, you cannot be serious in making me such a proposition!</p><p>mrs. cheveley.  I am quite serious.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">sir robert chiltern.  [<em>Coldly</em>.]  Pray allow me to believe</p></div> </div>
