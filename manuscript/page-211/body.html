A man’s life is of more value than a woman’s.  It has larger issues, wider scope, greater ambitions.  Our lives revolve in curves of emotions.  It is upon lines of intellect that a man’s life progresses.  I have just learnt this, and much else with it, from Lord Goring.  And I will not spoil your life for you, nor see you spoil it as a sacrifice to me, a useless sacrifice!</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  Gertrude!  Gertrude!</p><p>lady chiltern.  You can forget.  Men easily forget.  And I forgive.  That is how women help the world.  I see that now.</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  [<em>Deeply overcome by emotion</em>, <em>embraces her</em>.]  My wife! my wife!  [<em>To</em> lord goring.]  Arthur, it seems that I am always to be in your debt.</p><p>lord goring.  Oh dear no, Robert.  Your debt is to Lady Chiltern, not to me!</p></div> </div>
