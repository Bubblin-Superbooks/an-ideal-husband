Are you quite sure?</p><p>phipps.  His lordship told me that if a lady called I was to ask her to wait in the drawing-room.  [<em>Goes to the door of the drawing-room and opens it</em>.]  His lordship’s directions on the subject were very precise.</p><p>mrs. cheveley.  [<em>To herself_]  How thoughtful of him!  To expect the unexpected shows a thoroughly modern intellect.  [_Goes towards the drawing-room and looks in</em>.]  Ugh!  How dreary a bachelor’s drawing-room always looks.  I shall have to alter all this.  [phipps <em>brings the lamp from the writing-table</em>.]  No, I don’t care for that lamp.  It is far too glaring.  Light some candles.</p><p>phipps.  [<em>Replaces lamp</em>.]  Certainly, madam.</p><p>mrs. cheveley.  I hope the candles have very becoming shades.</p></div> </div>
