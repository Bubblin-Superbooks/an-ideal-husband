All I do know is that life cannot be understood without much charity, cannot be lived without much charity.  It is love, and not German philosophy, that is the true explanation of this world, whatever may be the explanation of the next.  And if you are ever in trouble, Lady Chiltern, trust me absolutely, and I will help you in every way I can.  If you ever want me, come to me for my assistance, and you shall have it.  Come at once to me.</p><p>lady chiltern.  [<em>Looking at him in surprise</em>.]  Lord Goring, you are talking quite seriously.  I donâ€™t think I ever heard you talk seriously before.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">lord goring.  [<em>Laughing</em>.]  You must excuse me, Lady</p></div> </div>
