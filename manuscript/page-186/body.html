You are quite right, my dear, quite right . . . as far as he is concerned, I mean.</p><p>mabel chiltern.  Do you think you could possibly make your son behave a little better occasionally?  Just as a change.</p><p>lord caversham.  I regret to say, Miss Chiltern, that I have no influence at all over my son.  I wish I had.  If I had, I know what I would make him do.</p><p>mabel chiltern.  I am afraid that he has one of those terribly weak natures that are not susceptible to influence.</p><p>lord caversham.  He is very heartless, very heartless.</p><p>lord goring.  It seems to me that I am a little in the way here.</p><p>mabel chiltern.  It is very good for you to be in the way, and to know what people say of you behind your back.</p></div> </div>
