Shouldn’t mind being introduced to my own tailor; he always votes on the right side.  But object strongly to being sent down to dinner with my wife’s milliner.  Never could stand Lady Caversham’s bonnets.</p><p>mabel chiltern.  Oh, I love London Society!  I think it has immensely improved.  It is entirely composed now of beautiful idiots and brilliant lunatics.  Just what Society should be.</p><p>lord caversham.  Hum!  Which is Goring?  Beautiful idiot, or the other thing?</p><p>mabel chiltern.  [<em>Gravely</em>.]  I have been obliged for the present to put Lord Goring into a class quite by himself.  But he is developing charmingly!</p><p>lord caversham.  Into what?</p><p>mabel chiltern.  [<em>With a little curtsey</em>.]  I hope to let you know very soon, Lord Caversham!</p></div> </div>
