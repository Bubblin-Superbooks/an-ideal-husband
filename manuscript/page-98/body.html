<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>lady chiltern.  Yes.  You have guessed it.  After you left last night I found out that what she had said was really true.  Of course I made Robert write her a letter at once, withdrawing his promise.</p><p>lord goring.  So he gave me to understand.</p><p>lady chiltern.  To have kept it would have been the first stain on a career that has been stainless always.  Robert must be above reproach.  He is not like other men.  He cannot afford to do what other men do.  [<em>She looks at</em> lord goring, <em>who remains silent</em>.]  Don’t you agree with me?  You are Robert’s greatest friend.  You are our greatest friend, Lord Goring.  No one, except myself, knows Robert better than you do.  He has no secrets from me, and I don’t think he has any from you.</p><p>lord goring.  He certainly has no secrets from me.  At least I don’t think so.</p><p>lady chiltern.  Then am I not right in my estimate of him?  I know I am right.  But speak to me frankly.</p></div> </div>
