I don’t know that I have been able to do much for you, Robert, as yet.  In fact, I have not been able to do anything for you, as far as I can see.  I am thoroughly disappointed with myself.</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  You have enabled me to tell you the truth.  That is something.  The truth has always stifled me.</p><p>lord goring.  Ah! the truth is a thing I get rid of as soon as possible!  Bad habit, by the way.  Makes one very unpopular at the club . . . with the older members.  They call it being conceited.  Perhaps it is.</p></div> </div>
