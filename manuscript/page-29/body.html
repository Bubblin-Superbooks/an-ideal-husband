But you have not told me yet what makes you honour London so suddenly.  Our season is almost over.</p><p>mrs. cheveley.  Oh! I don’t care about the London season!  It is too matrimonial.  People are either hunting for husbands, or hiding from them.  I wanted to meet you.  It is quite true.  You know what a woman’s curiosity is.  Almost as great as a man’s!  I wanted immensely to meet you, and . . . to ask you to do something for me.</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  I hope it is not a little thing, Mrs. Cheveley.  I find that little things are so very difficult to do.</p><p>mrs. cheveley.  [<em>After a moment’s reflection</em>.]  No, I don’t think it is quite a little thing.</p><p>sir robert chiltern.  I am so glad.  Do tell me what it is.</p></div> </div>
